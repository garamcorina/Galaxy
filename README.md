# Galaxy :milky_way:

This project was generated with :link: [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## Local setup :gear:

For running the project you will need to have Node.js and npm package manager installed.

### Installation Steps :computer:

Open the Terminal app and type `brew update`. This updates Homebrew with a list of the latest version of Node.
Type `brew install node`.
Sit back and wait. Homebrew has to download some files and install them. But thatâ€™s it.

You can run `node -v` to check if you already installed it. The same thing you should do for npm, run `npm -v`.

After you installed node.js and npm, you can run `npm install && npm run start` in your app terminal or step to ##Development server section directly. This command will automatically run your development server.Now you should be able to see your app at `http://localhost:4200/` in the browser window.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build :hammer_and_wrench:

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via :link:[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

That's it! Enjoy the app! :partying_face::champagne:
